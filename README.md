# ArduClaw
This project is a custom crane arm system using a stepper motor for rotation and a servo for a claw. It features sensors (PIR, ultrasonic, MPU6050, water, temp/humidity, IR) for safety. The arm switches modes and responds to remote commands. I put a lot into wiring, sensor placement, and coding, adapting example libraries for my setup.
